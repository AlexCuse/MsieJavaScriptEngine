   DESCRIPTION
   ===========
   This project is a .NET wrapper for working with the Internet Explorer's
   JavaScript engines (JsRT version of Chakra, ActiveScript version of
   Chakra and Classic JavaScript Engine).
   Project was based on the code of SassAndCoffee.JavaScript
   (http://github.com/paulcbetts/SassAndCoffee) and Chakra Sample Hosts
   (http://github.com/panopticoncentral/chakra-host).

   =============
   RELEASE NOTES
   =============
   1. In `ChakraActiveScript` mode added native support of ECMAScript 5
      (without polyfills);
   2. Added `JsEngineSettings` class for any reason in the future to
      abandon redundant constructors.
